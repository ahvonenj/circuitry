Circuitry is a 2D "circuit" simulator

It tries to be / become something similar, but standalone, to:

- Minecraft's redstone system
- Garry's mods wiremod
- Electric stuff of Fallout 4's settlement building system

So basically wire + components and some kind of tick and logic system behind all that.
